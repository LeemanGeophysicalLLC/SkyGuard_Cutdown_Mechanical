# SkyGuard Cutdown Mechanical

Mechanical components for the SkyGuard cutdown

## Servo Horn
Custom actuator for the servo - we recommend printing from ASA CF at ~15% infill.

Full enclosure for the unit - we recommend printing from PLA at 40% infill, with supports
, with 4 loop walls, and a gyroid infill for best results.
